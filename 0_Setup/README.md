# Setup

In this section, we will set up your environment for this course.

Everything in this course can be done on the system you set up here - whether it’s a dedicated machine or a virtual one.

## Requirements

### Optimal Setup

Ideally, you should have a separate device such as a spare laptop or desktop computer.

**Recommended specifications:**

* 4 GB RAM
* 100 GB storage
* CPU with at least 2 cores

If you have a dedicated device, follow this guide:
[Setting up a Linux Boot Drive](01_Setting_up_Linux_Boot_Drive.md)

---

### Minimum Setup

If you don’t have a spare device, you can run Linux in a **virtual machine**.

1. Make sure your PC supports **virtualization** (check your manufacturer’s documentation).
2. If you’re new to virtual machines, watch this introduction:
	[How to Install a VM (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM)
	→ Watch up to **minute 15** — after that, our approach will differ slightly.
3. Once your VM is ready, continue to:
