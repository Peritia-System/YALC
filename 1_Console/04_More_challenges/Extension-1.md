7. **Count Your Files**
   Use a command to count how many files are in your current directory.
   Hint: try combining `ls` with `wc`.

8. **Find a File by Name**
   Try to locate a file on your system using the `find` command.
   For example:

   ```bash
   find ~ -name Hello.md
   ```

9. **Check Disk Space**
   See how much free space you have on your system using:

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   Try to interpret what the columns mean.

10. **See What’s Running**
    Use `top` or `htop` (install it first!) to view currently running processes.
    See if you can identify what’s using the most memory.

11. **Create a Backup Copy**
    Copy the **Test** folder into a new directory called **Backup**.
    Confirm that both folders contain the same files.
