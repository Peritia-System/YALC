# Some fun tasks

Alright, with everything you’ve learned so far — it’s time to explore a bit on your own.
Try solving the following tasks using what you know (and maybe a bit of web searching).

## Tasks

1. **Install HyFetch**
   You’ve used `dnf` before — see if you can figure out how to install HyFetch you should install hyfetch and Fastfetch to properly use it.

2. **Configure HyFetch**
   Once it’s installed, run the command that lets you set it up and customize it.
   When it’s ready, take a screenshot and show off your first Linux setup somewhere fun (Reddit, maybe?).

3. **Make Bash Say Hello**
   Find a way to have your terminal praise you buy telling you sth.
   Something like:

   > Hello, good job!

4. **Create a New Directory**
   Make a folder called **Test**.
   Inside it, create two files named **Hello.md** and **IamLinuxing.txt**.

5. **Zip It**
   Compress the **Test** directory into a zip file.

6. **Unzip It Somewhere Else**
   Extract that zip file into your **Downloads** folder.

Once you’ve tried everything, check your results against the solutions — or come up with your own creative alternatives. The best way to learn Linux is to experiment, break things, and fix them again.
