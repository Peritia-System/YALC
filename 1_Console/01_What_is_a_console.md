# What Is a Console

A **console** is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with your computer by typing commands.
Instead of clicking buttons or using graphical menus, you control your system directly through written instructions.

## Why Use a Console

* **Efficiency:** Many tasks can be done faster by typing commands instead of navigating menus.
* **Control:** You have more power and flexibility over your system.
* **Automation:** You can combine commands into scripts to perform repetitive tasks automatically.
* **Universality:** Consoles work the same across many systems, especially in Linux environments.

## Console, Terminal, and Shell

These terms are related but slightly different:

* **Console:** Originally referred to the physical device (like a keyboard and screen) used to interact with a computer. Today, it generally means any text-based interface.
* **Terminal:** A program that provides access to the console. Examples include **GNOME Terminal**, **Konsole**, or **xterm**.
* **Shell:** The program that interprets and executes the commands you type, such as **bash**, **zsh**, or **fish**.

## Opening the Console

On most Linux systems, you can open a terminal by:

* Pressing **Ctrl + Alt + T**, or
* Searching for **“Terminal”** in your application menu.

## Example Command

Try typing the following command to display your current directory:

```bash
pwd
```

This stands for **“print working directory”**, and it shows you where you are in the file system.
